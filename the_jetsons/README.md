### Once Upon a Time;
This whole ~conundrum~ adventure started in 2017. When I lost my keys several times... in a week.  
I ended up buying [SCHLAGE Z-Wave Connect Touchscreen Deadbolt with Built-In Alarm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AGK9KOG) coupled with [Apple's Home.app](https://www.apple.com/home-app/).  
  
Once that was acquired, there was no going back; Unfortunately, this quickly proved to be limiting and needed some streamlining.  
  
I eventually ended up moving all my Zigbee and Zwave devices to a [HUSBZB-1 stick](https://amazon.ca/-/fr/QuickStick-Combo-HUSBZB-1-Nortek-Cert/dp/B0157GOEA8/?__mk_fr_CA=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=2JP8XY8SQ0LKQ&sprefix=nortek,tools,79) coupled with [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) which proved to be a very good decision, no more Zigbee drops or Zwave issues coming from the use of the SmartThings hub.

Eventually followed a [second server for storage and a nas for backups](/home_assistant/documentation/hardware.md), more devices [(Now over a hundred!)](/home_assistant/documentation/zigbee.md) and lots and lots of automations!  

This README is constantly evolving...
