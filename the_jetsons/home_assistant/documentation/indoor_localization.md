# Indoor Localisation Detection

Since I am always trying new things, I've explored indoor-localisation using 7 ESP32s and a [Minew Bracelet](https://www.minew.com/products/b7-wristband-beacon.html) attached to my ankle.  Alternatively, if the ankle monitor is not detected while I am still considered at home, my phone and watch BLE signals are checked to determine my current location. And If I am alone, the last active room is also checked.
[Here you can find the code to that sensor](https://github.com/maxi1134/Home-Assistant-Config/blob/5b6d5c134e9146d0b56d856bdd0e18f3f64bf2fb/includes/template.yaml#L476)  
  
This allows for a high level of precisions when it comes to knowing in which room I am located.  
  
  
As for the the software used for this, it is [free and open source](https://espresense.com/).

### The ESP32s are located as follow in the appartment, offering good detection in "main" rooms, and being less precise with others. <br>
